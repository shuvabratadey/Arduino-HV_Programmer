# What is High Voltage Programming ?
High Voltage Programming (HVP) is a method of programming microcontrollers and other electronic devices by applying a high voltage signal to the device's programming pins. This high voltage signal is typically in the range of 10-15 volts and is used to enable special programming modes in the device.

# Why it is use ?
HVP is used when the normal programming interface of the device is not accessible or when the device is in a locked state, preventing normal programming. HVP is also used to program devices that have been damaged or erased, allowing the device to be reprogrammed.

# How High Voltage Programming done ?
The HVP process involves applying a high voltage signal to the device's programming pins while providing the necessary programming data and commands through a programming tool or software. The programming data is loaded into the device's memory and the device is then reset to begin executing the newly programmed code. HVP should be performed with caution as it involves applying high voltage signals to electronic devices, which can potentially damage the device if not done correctly. It is recommended that HVP is only performed by experienced and qualified technicians.

# Arduino-HV_Programmer
This is a Arduino based High Voltage Fuse Resetter. This can reset the fuse of At-Mega 328P/328/8 or At-Tiny 85/13. This needs on a 12v DC Power source.
We can control this device using a software. which is given with its screen shots.
